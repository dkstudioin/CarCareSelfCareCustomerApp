## üëç About
We have file browsers, camera roll viewers and emoji pickers. Why not let your users jazz up their content using Lottie Files, too? Animations are presented to the user via an [`<InfiniteList/>`](https://github.com/foundcareers/react-native-infinite-flatlist), from which the user can pick to browser from one of the `recent`, `popular` or `featured` animations using [`crawl-lottie-files`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/crawl-lottie-files).

## ‚úçÔ∏è Example

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Alert } from 'react-native';
import LottieFilesPicker from '@cawfree/react-native-lottie-files-picker'

class AnimationScreen extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <LottieFilesPicker
        onSelect={({ path }) => {
          Alert.alert(`Looks like you picked ${path}. Nice choice.`);
        }}
      />
    );
  }
}

export default AnimationScreen;
```

Yup.
